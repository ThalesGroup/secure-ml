### ML Security Plan - Guidelines for Human Security

ID | TECHNIQUE | GUIDELINES
--- | --- | ---
HS1 | Training and awareness | 1. Security Training: Develop and deliver comprehensive security training programs for employees and stakeholders. Focus on the specific risks and best practices related to AI and ML security, including data protection, threat mitigation, and secure coding practices. Reference: [ML security attacks](../../ml-attacks/ml-taxonomy-cyberattacks.md) and [ML security threats](../../ml-threats/ml-threats.md) <br> 2. Awareness Campaigns: Launch regular awareness campaigns to reinforce the importance of AI and ML security. Use newsletters, posters, and webinars to highlight recent threats and remind employees of security protocols. <br> 3. Phishing Simulations: Conduct regular phishing simulations to test and improve employees' ability to recognize and respond to phishing attempts. Provide feedback and additional training based on the results of these simulations.
HS2 | Background checks | 1. Pre-employment Screening: Implement thorough background checks for new hires and contractors who will have access to sensitive AI and ML systems or data. This should include criminal history, employment verification, and reference checks. <br> 2. Periodic Re-screening: Conduct periodic re-screening of current employees and contractors to ensure ongoing trustworthiness, particularly for those in critical roles. <br> 3. Access Controls: Use the results of background checks to inform access controls, ensuring that only trustworthy individuals have access to sensitive systems and data.

HS3 | Incident response | 1. Incident Management: Develop a detailed incident response plan specifically for AI and ML security incidents. Define clear roles and responsibilities for team members, and establish procedures for identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from incidents. <br> 2. Forensics: Establish protocols for forensic investigations to determine the root cause and impact of security incidents. Ensure that forensic tools and capabilities are in place and that personnel are trained to use them. <br> 3. Communication Plan: Develop a communication plan for incident response, detailing how and when to communicate with internal stakeholders, external partners, and the public. Include predefined templates for common incident types. <br> 4. Incident Response Team: Form an incident response team with representatives from relevant departments, including IT, security, legal, and communications. Conduct regular drills to ensure preparedness.
HS4 | Governance and oversight | 1. Compliance Frameworks: Establish compliance frameworks to ensure AI and ML systems adhere to relevant regulations and standards. Regularly review and update these frameworks to reflect changes in the regulatory landscape. <br> 2. Security Dashboards: Implement security dashboards to provide real-time visibility into the security posture of AI and ML systems. Use these dashboards to monitor key metrics and identify potential risks. <br> 3. Risk Management: Develop a risk management process to identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with AI and ML systems. Include regular risk assessments and maintain a risk register to track and manage identified risks. <br> 4. Ethical Oversight: Create an ethical oversight committee to review and provide guidance on the ethical implications of AI and ML projects. Ensure that this committee includes diverse perspectives and expertise.
