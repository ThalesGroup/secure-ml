## ML Security Plan - Security Guidelines

### Data Security guidelines
To ensure the security of machine learning datasets in an organization, it's crucial to follow a set of comprehensive guidelines. These include encrypting sensitive data both in transit and at rest using strong algorithms and securely managing encryption keys. Access controls such as user authentication and role-based permissions help limit data access to authorized personnel only. Data should be classified based on sensitivity levels, with regular backups and a disaster recovery plan in place for emergencies. Anonymizing techniques protect individual privacy while maintaining data usefulness. Quality validation processes ensure the reliability of datasets for AI model training, while secure data sharing with third parties involves using encryption protocols and agreements to safeguard confidentiality. By adhering to these guidelines, organizations can effectively protect their machine learning datasets from unauthorized access or misuse, maintaining data integrity and security.

### Model security guidelines
Organizations committed to ML model security implement comprehensive version control, validate inputs and outputs for accuracy, ensure models are explainable and transparent, conduct rigorous robustness testing, continuously monitor for anomalies, and deploy models with stringent security measures. These practices ensure AI solutions are reliable, secure, and trustworthy for users.
