### ML Security Plan - Guidelines for Security Compliance

For context, please refer to the [earlier page](ml-secplan-guidelines.md) before proceeding with this content.

ID | TECHNIQUE | GUIDELINES
--- | --- | ---
SC1 | Regulatory compliance | 1. Regulatory Compliance Frameworks: Implement frameworks to ensure AI and ML systems comply with regulations like HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS, or ISO 27001. Regularly update policies to reflect changes in regulations. <br> 2. Data Protection Measures: Ensure all personal and sensitive data is encrypted and access is restricted based on need-to-know. Implement data masking and pseudonymization techniques where applicable. <br> Reference: [OWASP ASVS V8 Data Protection](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/en/0x16-V8-Data-Protection.md) <br> 3. Security Controls: Apply security controls as mandated by relevant standards, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), regular audits, and secure coding practices. <br> Reference: [ML Secure Coding](../../secure-coding/ml-secure-coding-guidelines.md) <br> 4. Privacy Requirements: Conduct privacy impact assessments (PIAs) to identify and mitigate privacy risks. Ensure transparency with users about data collection, usage, and sharing practices. <br> Reference: [ML Privacy Techniques](../../privacy/ml-privacy-techniques.md)
SC2 | Ethical considerations | 1. Bias Mitigation Techniques: Use techniques like re-weighting, re-sampling, or adversarial debiasing to reduce bias in datasets and models. Regularly evaluate model outputs for fairness. <br> 2. Ethical Frameworks: Adopt ethical AI frameworks such as those proposed by the IEEE or other industry bodies. Develop internal guidelines to address ethical considerations. <br> 3. Algorithmic Transparency: Document and disclose the decision-making processes of AI models. Use tools like LIME or SHAP to explain model predictions and ensure transparency.
SC3 | Data retention and deletion | 1. Data Minimization: Collect and retain only the data necessary for the intended purpose. Avoid collecting excessive or irrelevant information. <br> 2. Data Anonymization: Anonymize data wherever possible to protect individual privacy. Use techniques like k-anonymity, l-diversity, or differential privacy. <br> 3. Data Destruction: Implement secure data deletion practices to ensure data is irretrievably destroyed when no longer needed. Use tools that comply with standards like DoD 5220.22-M for data wiping. <br> Reference: [ML Secure Coding](../../secure-coding/ml-secure-coding-guidelines.md)
SC4 | Audit trails | 1. Logging: Implement comprehensive logging of data access, modifications, and system activities. Use centralized logging systems to aggregate and analyze logs. <br> 2. Monitoring: Continuously monitor logs for unusual or unauthorized activities. Use SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems to detect and respond to security incidents. <br> 3. Reporting: Generate regular compliance reports detailing access and usage patterns. Ensure reports are reviewed by security and compliance teams. <br> Reference: [OWASP ASVS V7 Error Handling and Logging](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/en/0x15-V7-Error-Logging.md)
SC5 | Security assessments | 1. Security Risk Assessments: Conduct regular security risk assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities in AI and ML systems. Use frameworks like NIST SP 800-30 to guide assessments. <br> 2. Security Audits: Perform periodic security audits to evaluate the effectiveness of security controls and compliance with regulatory requirements. Engage third-party auditors for unbiased assessments. <br> 3. Compliance Assessments: Regularly assess compliance with relevant regulations and standards. Document findings and remediation actions in detailed reports.
SC6 | Third-party risk management | 1. Vendor Risk Management: Evaluate the security posture of third-party vendors and partners. Ensure they have adequate security measures in place and comply with relevant regulations. <br> 2. Contractual Obligations: Include security and compliance requirements in contracts with third-party vendors. Mandate regular security assessments and audits as part of the contract. <br> 3. Access Controls: Restrict third-party access to sensitive data and systems. Implement strong access controls and monitor third-party activities for compliance.
