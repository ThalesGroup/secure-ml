### ML Security Plan - Security Guidelines for ML Platforms

ID | TECHNIQUE | GUIDELINES
--- | --- | ---
PS1 | Vulnerability scanning | 1. Regular Scanning: Schedule regular vulnerability scans of the entire AI/ML infrastructure using tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, or commercial solutions. Scan for vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, and network configurations. <br> 2. Penetration Testing: Conduct periodic penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify potential security weaknesses. Engage with third-party security experts to perform thorough assessments. <br> 3. Remediation: Prioritize and address identified vulnerabilities based on their severity. Develop and implement a remediation plan to mitigate risks promptly. <br> 4. Reporting: Maintain detailed reports of all scans and tests, documenting findings, remediation actions, and verification of fixes. Use these reports to improve the security posture continuously.
PS2 | Patch management | 1. Inventory Management: Maintain an inventory of all software and firmware components within the AI/ML infrastructure, including dependencies and third-party libraries. <br> 2. Patch Identification: Subscribe to security bulletins and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) to stay informed about new patches and updates. <br> 3. Patch Deployment: Establish a process for testing and deploying patches promptly. Use automated tools like WSUS, SCCM, or cloud-native services to streamline patch management. <br> 4. Verification: After applying patches, verify their successful implementation and ensure that systems operate as expected without introducing new issues.
PS3 | Access controls | 1. User Authentication: Implement strong user authentication mechanisms, such as password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and single sign-on (SSO) solutions. <br> 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define and enforce RBAC policies to ensure that users have access only to the resources necessary for their roles. Use IAM tools to manage roles and permissions. <br> 3. Least Privilege Principle: Apply the principle of least privilege to minimize access rights for users and processes. Regularly review and update access permissions. <br> 4. Access Monitoring: Continuously monitor and log access to the infrastructure. Use tools like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.
PS4 | Encryption | 1. Encryption in Transit: Use TLS to encrypt data transmitted over networks. Ensure all communication channels, including APIs, web interfaces, and internal services, use secure protocols. <br> 2. Encryption at Rest: Implement full-disk encryption for storage devices and databases. Use encryption tools and libraries that comply with industry standards (e.g., AES-256). <br> 3. Key Management: Use robust key management solutions to handle encryption keys securely. Implement key rotation policies and protect keys using hardware security modules (HSMs) or cloud key management services. <br> Reference: [OWASP ASVS V9 Communication](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/en/0x17-V9-Communications.md)
PS5 | Network hardening | 1. Firewalls: Deploy firewalls to filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules. Use both perimeter and host-based firewalls to protect the infrastructure. <br> 2. Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Implement IDS/IPS to detect and prevent malicious activities. Regularly update IDS/IPS signatures and monitor alerts. <br> 3. Network Segmentation: Segment the network to isolate critical components and limit the lateral movement of attackers. Use VLANs, subnets, and access control lists (ACLs) to enforce segmentation. <br> 4. Regular Audits: Conduct regular network security audits to ensure that security configurations are effective and up to date.
PS6 | Hardware security | 1. Physical Security: Implement physical security measures such as secure access controls to data centers, surveillance systems, and tamper-evident seals on hardware. <br> 2. Firmware Security: Ensure that firmware on hardware components, such as GPUs and TPUs, is up to date and sourced from trusted vendors. Apply firmware updates promptly to mitigate vulnerabilities. <br> 3. Hardware Attestation: Use hardware attestation techniques to verify the integrity of hardware components. Leverage Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) to enhance security. <br> 4. Regular Inspections: Conduct regular inspections and audits of hardware to detect and respond to signs of tampering or physical attacks.
PS7 | Secure Configuration | 1. Configuration Management: Implement configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef to enforce secure configurations consistently across all systems. <br> 2. Hardening Guides: Follow industry best practices and guidelines for system hardening, such as CIS benchmarks and NIST guidelines, to configure network, systems, and applications securely. <br> 3. Cloud Security: For cloud deployments, use cloud provider security services and follow best practices for secure configuration. Regularly review and update security groups, IAM policies, and other cloud security settings. <br> 4. Continuous Compliance: Implement continuous compliance monitoring to ensure that systems remain securely configured. Use automated tools to detect and remediate configuration drifts.
