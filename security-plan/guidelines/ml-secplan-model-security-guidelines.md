## ML Security Plan - Security Guidelines for ML Models

ID | TECHNIQUE | GUIDELINES
--- | --- | ---
MS1 | Secure development | 1. Code Repositories: Use version control systems like Git to manage and track changes to AI models. Establish a central repository for storing model code, configuration files, and dependencies. <br> 2. Branching: Implement a branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow) to manage development, testing, and production versions of models. Create separate branches for features, bug fixes, and releases. <br> 3. Environment Management: Use environment management tools like Docker and virtual environments to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments. Store environment configurations in version control. <br> 4. Code Review: Refer to [ML model code review guidelines](../../secure-coding/ml-security-code-review-guidelines.md). <br> 5. Secure Coding: Refer to [ML model secure coding guidelines](../../secure-coding/ml-secure-coding-guidelines.md)
MS2 | Input/output validation | 1. Implement input validations: Refer to [ML model input validations](../../secure-coding/ml-security-input-validations-models.md) <br> 2. Implement output validations: Refer to [ML model output validations](../../secure-coding/ml-security-output-validations-models.md)
MS3 | Model explainability | 1. Feature Importance Analysis: Use techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to identify and visualize the importance of different features in the model's decision-making process. <br> 2. Model Visualization: Employ tools like TensorBoard, matplotlib, or Plotly to visualize model architecture, training progress, and performance metrics. Provide clear visualizations to stakeholders to aid understanding. <br> 3. Documentation: Maintain comprehensive documentation explaining the model's structure, decision-making process, and the rationale behind feature selection and engineering. Include examples and case studies. <br> 4. Threat Modeling: Conduct threat modeling to identify potential security risks and vulnerabilities in the AI model. Document the findings and mitigation strategies to enhance transparency. Reference: [ML Threat Modeling Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/engineering/threat-modeling-aiml)
MS4 | Adversarial training & Robustness testing | 1. Malware Scanning: Regularly scan the environment and dependencies for malware using tools like ClamAV or commercial antivirus solutions. Ensure that all third-party libraries and components are from trusted sources. <br> 2. Adversarial Training: Train models using adversarial examples to improve robustness against input perturbations. Use frameworks like CleverHans or Foolbox to generate and test adversarial examples. <br> 3. Robustness Metrics: Evaluate model robustness using metrics such as accuracy under attack, robustness score, and stability measures. Continuously monitor these metrics to identify and address weaknesses. <br> 4. Model Hardening: Apply security patches and updates to the model and its dependencies. Conduct static and dynamic code analysis to identify and fix vulnerabilities. Avoid or mitigate the use of vulnerable third-party libraries. <br> Reference tools: [ML model security tools](../../tools/ml-security-tools.md)
MS5 | Monitoring and alerting | 1. Logging: Implement comprehensive logging to capture model inputs, outputs, and intermediate states. Use logging frameworks like Log4j or Python's logging module. <br> 2. Monitoring: Deploy monitoring solutions to track model performance, latency, and resource usage in real-time. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) can be utilized. <br> 3. Alerting: Set up alerts for anomalies or unexpected behaviors such as sudden performance degradation, unusual input patterns, or significant deviations in output distributions. Use alerting systems like PagerDuty or Opsgenie.
MS6 | Secure deployment | 1. Secure Communication Protocols: Ensure that data transmission between components (e.g., client-server, server-database) is encrypted using protocols like TLS. <br> Reference: [OWASP ASVS V9 Communication](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/en/0x17-V9-Communications.md) <br> 2. Access Controls: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to the model and its components. Use identity and access management (IAM) systems to manage permissions. <br> Reference: [OWASP ASVS V4 Access Control](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/en/0x12-V4-Access-Control.md) <br> 3. Authentication: Enforce strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), to secure access to the model and associated services. <br> Reference: [OWASP ASVS V2 Authentication](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/en/0x11-V2-Authentication.md) <br> 4. Reverse Engineering Protection: Employ obfuscation techniques and binary protections to safeguard the model against reverse engineering. Use tools like PyArmor for Python or ProGuard for Java. <br> 5. Deployment Environment: Use secure environments for deploying AI models, such as isolated VMs or containers with minimal privileges. Regularly update and patch the deployment environment to address security vulnerabilities.
