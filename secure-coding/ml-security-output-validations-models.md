## Security related output validation guidelines on Machine Learning model development and operations

Here's a breakdown of postprocessing and output validation techniques for LLMs (Large Language Models), along with Python code examples and ML algorithms where applicable. Please note that the code provided is just example reference and not to be used as-is.

*Disclaimer: Thales does not endorse the use of any specific Python library. The mention of such libraries is solely for illustrative purposes and informational use.*

### Deanonymize Scanner
```
from llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize
 
scanner = Deanonymize(vault)
sanitized_model_output, is_valid, risk_score = scanner.scan(sanitized_prompt, model_output)
 
#More details at https://llm-guard.com/output_scanners/deanonymize/
```

### Semantic Consistency and Coherence Checking
- Verify alignment with prompt: Ensure response aligns with the prompt's intent and context.
- Detect logical fallacies, contradictions, or nonsensical statements.
- Use natural language understanding (NLU) techniques to assess coherence.
```
import transformers
 
nlu_model = transformers.pipeline("question-answering")
 
def check_consistency(prompt, response):
    # Ask the NLU model questions about the response to assess coherence
    questions = ["Does the response make sense in the context of the prompt?", "Is the response logically consistent?"]
    answers = nlu_model(questions, context=prompt + response)
 
    # Analyze answers to detect inconsistencies or lack of coherence
    # ...
```

### Fact-Checking and Verification
- Cross-reference with external knowledge bases or sources to verify factual claims.
- Use information retrieval techniques to find relevant evidence.
```
import requests
 
def fact_check(response):
    # Extract factual claims from the response
    claims = extract_claims(response)
 
    # Verify each claim using an external fact-checking API or database
    for claim in claims:
        verification = requests.get(f"https://fact-checking-api.com/verify?claim={claim}")
        # ... Process verification results

```

### Bias and Fairness Detection
- Identify stereotypes, discriminatory language, or prejudiced opinions.
- Use bias detection tools or techniques to measure fairness and inclusivity.
```
import transformers
 
debiasing_model = transformers.pipeline("text-debiasing")
 
def detect_bias(response):
    # Debias the response using the model
    debiased_response = debiasing_model(response)
 
    # Compare original and debiased responses to identify potential biases
    # ...
 
#Another reference: https://llm-guard.com/output_scanners/bias/
```

### Anomaly Detection in Output
- Flag responses that deviate significantly from expected patterns or distributions.
- Use statistical techniques (e.g., outlier detection) to identify unusual responses.
```
# Similar to anomaly detection in input validation, but applied to generated responses

```

### Human-in-the-Loop Review (for highly sensitive business usecases)
- Incorporate human feedback to validate responses, especially for sensitive or high-risk applications.
- Implement mechanisms for users to flag problematic responses or provide corrections.
```
# No specific code example; this involves integrating a human review process
```

### Note
* Combine multiple postprocessing techniques for comprehensive validation.
* Tailor validation to specific LLM capabilities and use cases.
* Continuously evaluate and refine validation strategies.
* Stay informed about advancements in LLM output validation research.
