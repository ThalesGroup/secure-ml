### Security Guidelines for Datasets Requirements of ML Security Policy

For context, please refer to the [earlier page](ml-secpol-guidelines.md) before proceeding with this content.

ID | TECHNIQUE | GUIDELINES
--- | --- | ---
DS1 | Encryption |  1. Utilize strong encryption algorithms like AES or RSA for encrypting sensitive data. <br> 2. Implement encryption for data both in transit and at rest. <br> 3. Ensure that encryption keys are securely managed, stored separately from the encrypted data, and accessible only to authorized personnel. <br> 4. Regularly rotate encryption keys and employ key management best practices to prevent unauthorized access. <br> Alternatively, refer to [OWASP ASVS V6 Stored Cryptography](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/en/0x14-V6-Cryptography.md),  <br> [OWASP ASVS V8 Data Protection](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/en/0x16-V8-Data-Protection.md), <br> [OWASP ASVS V9 Communication](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/en/0x17-V9-Communications.md). <br> Industry Reference: NIST Special Publication 800-175B - "Guideline for Using Cryptographic Standards in the Federal Government: Cryptographic Mechanisms."
DS2 | Access Controls | 1. Implement user authentication mechanisms such as username-password authentication or biometric authentication. <br> 2. Utilize role-based access control (RBAC) to assign permissions based on users' roles and responsibilities. <br> 3. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security. <br> 4. Log and monitor access to sensitive data to detect and respond to any unauthorized access attempts. <br> Alternatively, refer to [OWASP ASVS V4 Access Control](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/en/0x12-V4-Access-Control.md). <br> Industry Reference: ISO/IEC 27001 - "Information technology — Security techniques — Information security management systems — Requirements."
DS3 | Data classification, backups and recovery | 1. Classify data based on sensitivity labels (e.g., public, internal, confidential, restricted). <br> 2. Implement regular data backups with appropriate frequency (e.g., daily, weekly) and retention periods. <br> 3. Establish a disaster recovery plan outlining procedures for data restoration in case of breaches, natural disasters, or other emergencies. <br> 4. Test the disaster recovery plan regularly to ensure its effectiveness. <br> Industry Reference: ISO/IEC 27002 - "Information technology — Security techniques — Code of practice for information security controls."
DS4 | Data anonymization | 1. Remove personally identifiable information (PII) from datasets before use. <br> 2. Utilize techniques such as data masking or tokenization to replace sensitive data with anonymized or pseudonymized equivalents. <br> 3. Ensure that the anonymization process does not compromise the utility or quality of the data for machine learning purposes. <br> Industry Reference: GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) Recital 26 - "The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person."
DS5 | Data quality control | 1. Implement processes for data validation to ensure the quality and integrity of the datasets used for training and testing. <br> 2. Perform file and content validation checks to detect any anomalies or inconsistencies in the data. <br> 3. Regularly scan datasets for malware or other malicious content using antivirus software or intrusion detection systems. <br> Industry Reference: IEEE Standard 1012-2016 - "IEEE Standard for System, Software, and Hardware Verification and Validation."
DS6 | Secure data sharing | 1. Use secure data transfer protocols such as HTTPS, SFTP, or encrypted email when sharing data with third parties. <br> 2. Establish data usage agreements outlining the purposes, limitations, and responsibilities associated with the shared data. <br> 3. Implement data access controls to restrict third-party access to only the necessary data for their intended purposes. <br> 4. Regularly review and audit third-party access to ensure compliance with security policies and regulations. <br> Industry Reference: ISO/IEC 27040 - "Information technology — Security techniques — Storage security."
